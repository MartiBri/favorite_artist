    <p><b>“Untouchable”</b> was the first song he put out after his release, and he used it to delineate the challenge he was facing: “Just a few days ago I was locked up in them chains/Now I’m in back of the Maybach with a lot of bands.” On “Graffiti,” he laments, “You know I got money but I’m in a hole/Scared I’ma die when I’m out on the road.”</P><br>

    <p>At the beginning of the video for <mark><i>“Untouchable,”</i></mark> YoungBoy Never Broke Again shows a clip of a conversation he had with <a href="https://meekmill.com/">Meek Mill</a> right after his release. “You gotta move or you gonna die,” Meek Mill warns him. It’s said with insistence and a filial tenderness. Not that many years ago, Meek Mill, also a lucid tough-talker, was in the same position, and despite having come far, his career has stalled; he’s not quite the star he might have been in an earlier time. For YoungBoy Never Broke Again, he is both a role model and a cautionary tale.</p>

    <p>In his most recent video for the song, <mark><i>“Genie,”</i></mark> a track YoungBoy describes as a “pain song,” he’s seen in his courtyard, cut with shots of recent articles about the rapper’s arrest as well as footage from news broadcasts about his run-ins with the <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8221654/youngboy-never-broke-again-legal-troubles-timeline"><b>LAW</b></a>. In the song, YoungBoy raps, “I got my static when you ride with me/ We got pulled over no you ain’t going to do no time for me/ I put my hands up police drew down on me/ So many charges make me wanna go way overseas.” The sentiment is emphasized with a repetitive chorus where the lyricist raps about working on his problems.</p>
